    <header>How to Play who wants to be a millionaire</header>
    <p>In who wants to be a millioniare?, contestants mjust answer a series of 15 multiple<br>
        choice questionsto win increasing amounts of money. There's no time limit, and<br>
        players recieve three lifelines to help with questions.<br>
        The game is divided into five difficulty levels, each containing three questions that<br>
        get progressively harder:<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1:Questions 1-3(easiest)<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2:Questions 4-6(slightly harder)<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3: Questions 7-9 (moderate difficulty)<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 4: Questions 10-12 (very difficult)<br>
        *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 4: Questions 13-15 (most difficult)<br>
        Questions within a level share a similar difficulty but can cover a variety of topics.<br>
        The game also featyres three "safe havens" at Question 5, 10, and 15, where<br>
        contestants secure their winnings. if a player answers incorrectly before reaching a <br>
        safe haven, they risk losing a significant portion of their accumulated money.
